# Python Scripts

This folder contains various I've written in python, most of them using pre-existing libraries. 

## List of files:

- RVGmt.py: This uses pytube and attempts to generate a random youtube link

- ytdl.py: Another pytube script, downloads youtube videos in either mp4 or mp3 format. To handle mp3, we use FFMPEG
